            <h2>Early Life & Background</h2>
            <p>
                I was born on the beautiful Madeira Island in Portugal. Growing up, my dad introduced me to video games, sparking a lifelong passion for interactive entertainment. I was also an avid comic book reader and collector, which helped foster my imagination and creative side.

        <section id="journey">
            <h2>The Journey to the UK</h2>
            <p>
                At 17, driven by a desire to explore the world and pursue an education that wasn't available at home, I moved to the UK. I started university life during the challenging times of COVID, arriving just a month before BREXIT. Despite the hurdles, I found comfort in the strong Portuguese community in Leicester.

        <!-- Academic Achievements -->
        <section id="academics">
            <h2>Academic Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                I earned a Bachelor's in Games Programming at De Montfort University, achieving First Class Honours-an achievement I'm particularly proud of, especially since I balanced my studies with working 3-4 days a week. Group projects were a vital part of my learning, helping me develop effective collaboration and problem-solving skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am pursuing my Master's in Games Engineering at the University of Warwick. This is a natural progression in my educational journey and offers a wealth of opportunities to learn and take on more responsibility. I'm currently working on a thesis about LOD changes in the animation of MetaHumans (no spoilers!).

        <!-- Professional Aspirations & Projects -->
        <section id="professional">
            <h2>Professional Aspirations & Projects</h2>
            <p>
                My goal is to embark on a career where I can continually explore new technologies and techniques, never falling into a mundane routine. I have been involved in several exciting projects including a networked chatroom, a rasterizer, CPU-based ray tracing, and a custom physics engine-alongside numerous group projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                These projects not only reflect my technical skills but also my drive to innovate and learn from every opportunity.

            <p>
                I'm a driven and collaborative individual who values both hard work and creativity. My cultural identity is very important to me, and it shapes the way I approach challenges and create solutions. My friends and colleagues describe me as friendly and professional, someone who is always eager to grow and help others along the way.

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                I believe that every project and every challenge is an opportunity to learn. As I continue my academic and professional journey, I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative game technologies and dynamic teams that push the boundaries of what is possible.
